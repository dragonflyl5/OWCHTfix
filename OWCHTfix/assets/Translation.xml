	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don’t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the &lt;color=orange&gt;Vessel&lt;/color&gt;’s core.</key>
		<value>OENO: 我认为，目前最大的困难是没有这种强力核心的设计图；我们当中也没有任何一个人是&lt;color=orange&gt;母舰&lt;/color&gt;核心的原设计者。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our &lt;color=orange&gt;Black Hole Forge&lt;/color&gt; is adept at crafting simpler cores.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 的确如此，但Poke曾是Annona的学徒。而Annona就是母舰核心的原设计者。我们的&lt;color=orange&gt;黑洞锻造室&lt;/color&gt;也能熟练地制造简单的跃迁核心。</value>
	</entry>

		<key>CASSAVA: Is it, though? We’ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye&lt;/color&gt; is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.</key>
		<value>CASSAVA: 这真的值得冒险吗？我们已经花费了太多时间去寻找一个我（和一些人）都已相信不可能找到的东西。如果寻找&lt;color=lightblue&gt;眼&lt;/color&gt;的任务只是徒劳一场，我们就应当选择潜在损失最小的方案。</value>

			CASSAVA: If Poke and I are oil and water, Clary is our emulsifier. She certainly makes us a better team than would mixing through shaking (although sometimes I would like to shake Poke!).
		</key>
		<value>
			CASSAVA: 如果我与Poke像是油水不溶，Clary就是我们之间的乳化剂。 比起为了互溶而猛烈地摇晃，她的确帮助了我们更好地合作共事 。(但我有时真的很想把Poke狠狠地摇一顿！).

			POKE: I feel strange, trying to recreate Annona’s warp core without him. At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his (very young) apprentice, and for the &lt;color=orange&gt;Black Hole Forge&lt;/color&gt; to be in my care and not his.
		</key>
		<value>
			POKE: 在没有Annona的情况下尝试复原他的跃迁核心让我有种奇怪的感受。有时，想到自己不再是他（非常年轻）的学徒，&lt;color=orange&gt;黑洞锻造室&lt;/color&gt;也已由我管理而不是他时，我还是会感觉到奇怪。

			POKE: To have the chance to try is thrilling, but... I don’t want to disappoint everyone. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I can do this (probably), but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?
		</key>
		<value>
			POKE: 得到这个尝试的机会令我振奋不已，但...我不想让大家感到失望。我&lt;i&gt;觉得&lt;/i&gt;我能够做到（也许吧），但万一是我激动的情绪导致我错误的估计了自己的能力呢？
		</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>
			POKE: Was I wrong in volunteering to build it...? I was born in this star system, and never saw Annona’s warp core with my own three eyes. I only know what he taught me. What if I’ve bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?
		</key>
		<value>
			POKE: 我是不是不应该主动接下制造核心的任务...？我出生在这个太阳系，而我的三只眼睛从未见过Annona的跃迁核心。我仅仅知道他所教给我的知识。万一这件任务的困难程度远超我的能力所及呢？
		</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>
			POKE: Still, all I can give is my best. And as Annona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what’s needed. I have Clary and Root in the forge, and I have my clan. I am not alone!
		</key>
		<value>
			POKE: 尽管如此，我所能做的只有尽己所能。正如Annona说的那样，如果事实证明我的能力还不够，那么我将另辟蹊径实现所需的目标。我有在锻造所的Clary和Root，我还有我的家族。我并不孤单！

			CLARY: This is troublesome: It seems the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;comet&lt;/color&gt; wishes to submerge our &lt;color=orange&gt;shuttle&lt;/color&gt; in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the &lt;color=orange&gt;shuttle&lt;/color&gt; may freeze entirely.
		</key>
		<value>
			CLARY: 这可真是麻烦。这颗&lt;color=lightblue&gt;彗星&lt;/color&gt;似乎想要把我们的&lt;color=orange&gt;穿梭机&lt;/color&gt;冻在冰里。如果我们在地表上停留太久，&lt;color=orange&gt;穿梭机&lt;/color&gt;可能会被完全冻住。
		</value>

		<key>POKE: Even if it did, couldn’t someone call it back home to the &lt;color=orange&gt;gravity cannon&lt;/color&gt; on &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Ember Twin&lt;/color&gt;?</key>
		<value>POKE: 就算它被冻住了，&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;上&lt;color=orange&gt;重力砲&lt;/color&gt;那边的人也能将它召回不是吗?</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>PYE: Yes, but the exploration of the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;comet&lt;/color&gt; would be more difficult if we were without the &lt;color=orange&gt;shuttle&lt;/color&gt; until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn’t have landed on the dark side of the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;comet&lt;/color&gt;...</key>
		<value>PYE: 对，但如果无法方便地进出&lt;color=orange&gt;穿梭机&lt;/color&gt;，在&lt;color=lightblue&gt;彗星&lt;/color&gt;的探索任务将会变得更困难。可能我们就不应该在&lt;color=lightblue&gt;彗星&lt;/color&gt;的背阴面着陆...</value>

		<key>CLARY: Suppose one of us remained in the &lt;color=orange&gt;shuttle&lt;/color&gt; to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 我建议我们当中其中一个留在&lt;color=orange&gt;穿梭机&lt;/color&gt;里保持其温度并继续监测地表。</value>

		<key>PYE: This would be wise, I think, Clary. If you don’t mind waiting here with it, Poke and I can continue to investigate the surface.</key>
		<value>PYE: Clary，那是个明智的建议。如果你不介意在穿梭机里等我们，Poke和我会继续进行地表的探索。</value>

		<key>CLARY: Regarding the warp towers on &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Ash Twin&lt;/color&gt;: Does each tower have to be perfectly aligned with the center of the astral body to which it’s tuned?</key>
		<value>CLARY: 关于&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;上的跃迁塔我有一个疑问：每座塔是否必须准确地对准其对应天体的中心？</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, but if, for example, a tower’s base were to shift even slightly, that tower might no longer align with its astral body.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 我和我身边的Nomai人一样喜欢精确，但如果，举例而言，一座塔的地基稍有偏差，那座塔就可能无法再对准其对应的天体了。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: We don’t need the alignment angle to be exact; it only needs to be within five degrees of the astral body’s center.</key>
		<value>POKE: 对准角不需要完全准确；只需在天体中心的五度范围内即可。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: Of note: This gives us a slightly longer warp window. I imagine this window will last roughly several seconds.</key>
		<value>POKE: 需要注意的是：这使得跃迁窗口的持续时间稍长一些。我认为窗口会持续大约数秒。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: As such, any Nomai stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped. We will need to be careful around the platform for the duration of the time it’s active to avoid accidental transportation.</key>
		<value>POKE: 在这种情况下，任何在窗口激活时踏上跃迁平台的人都会被立刻跃迁。因此，窗口激活期间，在跃迁平台附近活动时需要小心，以免发生意外的传送。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: More accurately, I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, provided the next Nomai is not Poke.</key>

	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: All of the warp towers are being constructed on &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Ash Twin&lt;/color&gt;, so the black hole cores will go there.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 所有的跃迁塔都建造在&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;上，所以黑洞核心都要送到那里去。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: The white hole cores are for the warp receivers. Each of the six receivers are being constructed at different locations, so those deliveries will be a greater pain in your cervical spine.</key>
		<value>POKE: 白洞核心都要安装在跃迁接收器上。六个接收器都分别建造在了不同的地点，运送它们的任务可要让你的颈椎剧烈疼痛了。</value>

		<value>CLARY: Poke，我很快就会回到&lt;color=orange&gt;锻造室&lt;/color&gt;；我要跟上Root去帮助他把第一颗核心运送到&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;，我得确保Yarrow能收到它。</value>

		<value>POKE: &lt;color=lightblue&gt;余烬星&lt;/color&gt;上的&lt;color=orange&gt;高能实验室&lt;/color&gt;里的跃迁塔设计图展示了每个接收器的位置。有疑问可以找Yarrow，他对此很熟悉。</value>

		<value>警告：请不要在&lt;color=orange&gt;黑洞锻造室&lt;/color&gt;升降时靠近对接区域。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: Of note: Yarrow believes he spotted a flaw in the warp tower designs: namely, that one of the warp towers on &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Ash Twin&lt;/color&gt; will never activate, because its warp receiver will never align overhead.</key>
		<value>POKE: 值得注意的是：Yarrow以为他发现了跃迁塔设计的一处缺陷：即&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;上有一座跃迁塔将永远无法启动，因为其跃迁接收器永远不能在其正上方与之对齐。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>POKE: Does your romantic interest think a warp tower’s alignment point is its &lt;i&gt;receiver&lt;/i&gt;? Does he not know that a warp tower always aligns with the center of its corresponding astral body?</key>
		<value>POKE: 你的恋爱对象是不是以为跃迁塔的对准点是它的&lt;i&gt;接收器&lt;/i&gt;？他难道不知道跃迁塔只需对准其对应天体的中心吗？</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: That isn’t an unreasonable belief, given the receiver &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have to be located on (or in close orbit around) the relevant astral body.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 他的想法是可以理解的，因为接收器&lt;i&gt;确实&lt;/i&gt;必须位于对应天体上(或者位于环绕该天体的低轨道上)。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: I seem to recall that was &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; understanding of warp technology, at first.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 我似乎还记得&lt;i&gt;你&lt;/i&gt;以前对跃迁科技的理解不也是这样吗。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>CLARY: No, Yarrow understands the distinction. He likely doesn’t realize the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Hourglass Twins&lt;/color&gt; are so close together they function as a single astral body, with a shared alignment point in between them.</key>
		<value>CLARY: 不，Yarrow当然知道跃迁塔的原理。他很可能只是没有意识到&lt;color=lightblue&gt;沙漏双星&lt;/color&gt;间的距离很近，因此它们可以被看做单个天体，而它们的共用对准点位于它们之间。</value>

		<value>PHLOX: 举例而言，可以将&lt;color=orange&gt;深巨星&lt;/color&gt;跃迁塔设计为气旋的样式。而&lt;color=orange&gt;木炉星&lt;/color&gt;跃迁塔则可以设计为间歇泉山的样式！</value>

		<value>CASSAVA: Conoy，只透过&lt;color=orange&gt;投影池&lt;/color&gt;我不能理解问题的答案。请问你能在我来&lt;color=orange&gt;观测站&lt;/color&gt;时为我讲解一下吗？</value>

		<key>CONOY: If you don’t mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole, I’d be delighted to see you! (There are two trailheads, one at &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Brittle Hollow&lt;/color&gt;'s &lt;color=orange&gt;gravity cannon&lt;/color&gt; and one at the &lt;color=orange&gt;Tower of Quantum Knowledge&lt;/color&gt;.)</key>
		<value>CONOY: 如果你不介意在地表下跋涉到南极的话，我会很高兴与你见面的。(有两处道路起点，其中一个位于&lt;color=lightblue&gt;碎空星&lt;/color&gt;&lt;color=orange&gt;重力砲&lt;/color&gt;，另一个位于&lt;color=orange&gt;量子知识之塔&lt;/color&gt;。)</value>

		<key>COLEUS: I was upstairs testing the &lt;color=orange&gt;Eye signal locator&lt;/color&gt;, and it can hear and follow the signals from the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;sun&lt;/color&gt;, &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Giant’s Deep&lt;/color&gt;, and &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Brittle Hollow&lt;/color&gt;.</key>
		<value>COLEUS: 我刚才在楼上测试&lt;color=orange&gt;眼信号定位器&lt;/color&gt;，它能够接收并跟随来自&lt;color=lightblue&gt;太阳&lt;/color&gt;、&lt;color=lightblue&gt;深巨星&lt;/color&gt;和&lt;color=lightblue&gt;碎空星&lt;/color&gt;的信号。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>COLEUS: However, something strange is happening when I ask the &lt;color=orange&gt;Eye signal locator&lt;/color&gt; to follow the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye&lt;/color&gt;’s signal: The device’s indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.</key>
		<value>COLEUS: 但当我让&lt;color=orange&gt;眼信号定位器&lt;/color&gt;跟随&lt;color=lightblue&gt;眼&lt;/color&gt;的信号时，奇怪的事发生了：仪器的指示器疯狂转动，无法指向任何方向。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>THATCH: This is a curious result. It’s possible the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye&lt;/color&gt; has stopped calling out its signal.</key>
		<value>THATCH: 这值得思考。有可能&lt;color=lightblue&gt;眼&lt;/color&gt;已经停止发出它的信号了。</value>

		<key>CASSAVA: It saddens me to posit this, my friends, but I believe this &lt;color=orange&gt;locator&lt;/color&gt; cannot detect the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye&lt;/color&gt;’s signal. We would need to build a more sensitive device if we want to locate the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye of the universe&lt;/color&gt;.</key>
		<value>CASSAVA: 朋友们，我必须遗憾的指出，这个&lt;color=orange&gt;定位器&lt;/color&gt;无法探测到&lt;color=lightblue&gt;眼&lt;/color&gt;的信号。我们可能需要建造一个更灵敏的仪器来定位&lt;color=lightblue&gt;宇宙之眼&lt;/color&gt;。</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>THATCH: Then we will build it. Don’t lose hope, Cassava; our search for the &lt;color=lightblue&gt;Eye&lt;/color&gt; is what brought our clan to this place. We won’t give up so easily!</key>
		<value>THATCH: 那我们就造吧。Cassava，不要失去希望; 我们的家族来到此地的目的正是为了寻找&lt;color=lightblue&gt;眼&lt;/color&gt;。我们不会如此轻易地放弃！</value>

		<key>PYE: Ramie and I will be running this experiment until one of us (specifically, me) can prove the other wrong, so although it’s inconvenient, the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the &lt;color=orange&gt;Sunless City&lt;/color&gt;.</key>
		<value>PYE: Ramie和我将持续进行这一实验，直到我们双方其中一个（特别是我）能够证明对方的假设是错的；虽然会造成不便，实验室目前只能从&lt;color=orange&gt;背阴城&lt;/color&gt;的道路进入。</value>

		<value>
			ILEX: 如果我们不再建造其他新的东西，或者拆解掉其他建筑(比如&lt;color=lightblue&gt;灰烬星&lt;/color&gt;上的那些跃迁塔)，我们或许就能比较容易地获得建造母舰的组件。
